### 🧩 People-and-Pages-Recommendations

A project to recommend:
- **People you may know** based on mutual friends  
- **Pages you might like** based on shared interests and liked pages

It uses structured **JSON data**, and applies logic similar to what social platforms use.  
Perfect example of **raw data processing, dictionary operations, and ranking systems** in Python.

📁 Repo contains:
- JSON files (cleaned and raw)
- Python scripts for friend/page recommendations
- Data cleaning and display utilities
